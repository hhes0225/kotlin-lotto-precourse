# kotlin-lotto-precourse
## Project Description
A console-based Lotto ticket machine written in Kotlin 1.9.24.  
The user can purchase Lotto tickets, input winning numbers, and check the lottery results and profit rate.  
This project focuses on clean object-oriented design by grouping related functions into classes and writing unit tests for all business logic.  
All inputs are validated, and errors are re-prompted according to functional requirements.  
The solution follows Kotlin coding conventions and the project process guidelines specified for the pre-course.

## Feature List

### Input Handling
- At each input step, if the user inputs invalid data, 
the program must throw an `IllegalArgumentException` and re-prompt input from that step.

1. enter the total price to purchase lottery tickets
  - Each ticket costs **1,000 KRW**
  - Amount must be divisible by 1,000
  - $\text{Number  of  tickets} = \text{Total  Price  Input}/1000$
```
Please enter the purchase amount.
8000
```

2. enter the winning numbers and bounus number
  - Input 6 unique winning numbers(comma-separated)
  - Input 1 unique bounus number
```
Please enter last week's winning numbers.
1,2,3,4,5,6

Please enter the bonus number.
```


### Generate Lotto Numbers
- For each ticket, generate 6 unique random numbers
  - Range for lotto number: $1 <= n <= 45$
  - Use `Randoms.pickUniqueNumbersInRange()` provided by the `camp.nextstep.edu.missionutils` package
  

### Check Winning Prize Ranks
- Based on the following criteria, determine the prize for each ticket:

|Prize Ranks|Criteria|Prize Amount (KRW)|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1st|Match 6 numbers|2,000,000,000|
|2nd|Match 5 numbers + Bonus number|30,000,000|
|3rd|Match 5 numbers|1,500,000|
|4th|Match 4 numbers|50,000|
|5th|Match 3 numbers|5,000|

- Matching is based on unique number comparisons(no duplicate matches allowed)


### Calculate Profit Rate
- Calculate the `total return rate` using the formula

  $\text{Profit Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Prize Amount}}{\text{Total Purchase Amount}} \right) \times 100$
  
- `Total Prize Amount` using the formula
  
  $\text{Total Prize Amount} =$
  
  $(1\text{st Prize Amount}) \times (1\text{st Win Tickets}) + (2\text{nd Prize Amount}) \times (2\text{nd Win Tickets}) +$
  
  $(3\text{rd Prize Amount}) \times (3\text{rd Win Tickets}) + (4\text{th Prize Amount}) \times (4\text{th Win Tickets}) +$
  
  $(5\text{th Prize Amount}) \times (5\text{th Win Tickets})$
- The profit rate must be rounded to the nearest tenth (e.g., 62.5%).  

### Print Output
1. Number of tickets issued and their numbers(sorted in ascending order)
```
You have purchased 8 tickets.
[8, 21, 23, 41, 42, 43]
[3, 5, 11, 16, 32, 38]
[7, 11, 16, 35, 36, 44]
[1, 8, 11, 31, 41, 42]
[13, 14, 16, 38, 42, 45]
[7, 11, 30, 40, 42, 43]
[2, 13, 22, 32, 38, 45]
[1, 3, 5, 14, 22, 45]
```

2. Lotto result statistics
```
3 Matches (5,000 KRW) - 1 tickets
4 Matches (50,000 KRW) - 0 tickets
5 Matches (1,500,000 KRW) - 0 tickets
5 Matches + Bonus Ball (30,000,000 KRW) - 0 tickets
6 Matches (2,000,000,000 KRW) - 0 tickets
```

3. Print profit rate
Based on `Calculate Profit Rate` Function, print the result of `Calculate Profit Rate`
